<table><tr><td><p><strong>OPTIQ</strong></p><p><em>India's Smartest F&amp;O Intelligence Platform</em></p><p><strong>PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT</strong></p><p>Version 1.0  |  February 2026  |  Confidential</p></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><p>Built for Indian retail traders who want to understand <strong><em>why</em></strong> markets move — not just <strong><em>what</em></strong> they do.</p></td></tr></table><h1><strong>1. Executive Summary</strong></h1><p>India's options and futures market (NSE F&amp;O) is one of the largest derivatives markets in the world by volume, yet the tools available to retail traders range from inadequate to actively misleading. Platforms like Sensibull provide Greeks and strategy payoff charts, but they stop short of explaining market forces in plain language — leaving traders to guess why a strategy that looked perfect on paper went wrong in live conditions.</p><p>OPTIQ changes that. It is a browser-based trading intelligence platform purpose-built for Indian equity derivatives (NSE/BSE Stock Options, Nifty/BankNifty options, and F&amp;O segments). The platform combines:</p><ul><li>A Rust-powered signal and backtesting engine for speed and accuracy</li><li>An AI layer that translates strategy outcomes into plain-language explanations — not jargon</li><li>Real-time, uninterrupted live market data sourced from NSE/BSE via Indian data providers</li><li>A full strategy builder that covers payoffs, Greeks, IV analysis, and scenario simulation</li><li>A free tier designed to acquire users with zero upfront infrastructure cost, scaling to paid plans as the user base grows</li></ul><p>The product is designed for a non-technical founder starting lean, validating with free-tier infrastructure, and scaling to a sustainable SaaS business targeting Indian retail F&amp;O traders — a market of over 45 million active derivatives traders and growing.</p><h1><strong>2. Problem Statement</strong></h1><p>Indian retail F&amp;O traders face three compounding problems that no existing platform solves together:</p><h2><strong>2.1  Data Interruption &amp; Reliability</strong></h2><p>Most retail-grade platforms (including free broker APIs) suffer from feed drops, WebSocket disconnections, and rate limits that cause strategies to miss signals or execute at wrong prices. For F&amp;O traders where a 5-second delay during expiry can mean the difference between profit and ruin, this is a critical failure point.</p><h2><strong>2.2  Strategy Understanding Gap</strong></h2><p>When a strategy fails, platforms show P&amp;L graphs but never explain what actually happened — was it IV crush post-earnings? A sudden shift in Put-Call Ratio? Institutional block deals that moved spot? Retail traders are left reading forums and YouTube instead of learning from their own data. This is the deepest and most underserved problem in the space.</p><h2><strong>2.3  Speed Limitations in Backtesting</strong></h2><p>Python-based backtesting (the industry default) is slow. Running a 12-month backtest on 0DTE Nifty options with minute-level data can take 15-40 minutes. This discourages iteration. A Rust engine brings this down to under 30 seconds, enabling traders to test dozens of hypotheses in a single session.</p><h1><strong>3.

Already uses strategies like Iron Condors, ratio spreads, calendar spreads. Needs the fastest backtesting, real-time OI analytics, and institutional-grade signal quality. Willing to pay ₹5,000–₹15,000/month for the right tool.</p><h1><strong>5. Core Feature Modules</strong></h1><table><tr><td><p><strong>MODULE 1 — Live Data Engine</strong></p></td></tr></table><h2><strong>5.1  Uninterrupted Live Market Data</strong></h2><p>This is the hardest engineering challenge and the most critical reliability requirement. The platform must never drop data during market hours (9:15 AM – 3:30 PM IST), especially around high-volatility events like RBI decisions, Budget announcements, and monthly expiries.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Data Source Strategy</strong></p></td><td><p>Primary: Upstox or Zerodha WebSocket API (free tier available). Fallback: NSE official data feed or Dhan API. Secondary fallback: Cached 1-minute OHLCV from TrueData (₹800/month). The Rust engine manages reconnection logic and fills gaps automatically.</p></td></tr></table><ul><li>Real-time option chain streaming: All strikes across current and next expiry</li><li>Live Open Interest (OI) data with change tracking: Critical for detecting institutional positioning</li><li>Implied Volatility (IV) per strike in real-time with IV percentile vs. 1-year history</li><li>Put-Call Ratio (PCR) streaming at index and stock level</li><li>India VIX live feed with rate of change alerts</li><li>FII/DII provisional data integration (updated every 30 min via NSE website scrape)</li><li>Auto-reconnect: Rust WebSocket client reconnects within 200ms of any drop</li><li>Data gap filler: If a candle is missed, it reconstructs from tick data or flags for the user</li></ul><table><tr><td><p><strong>MODULE 2 — Rust Signal &amp; Backtesting Engine</strong></p></td></tr></table><h2><strong>5.2  The Rust Performance Core</strong></h2><p>The signal engine is written in Rust — a language that is 10 to 100 times faster than Python for numerical computation. This engine runs entirely on the server, invisible to the user, but responsible for all the heavy lifting: backtesting, signal computation, Greeks calculation, and scenario simulation.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Why Rust?</strong></p></td><td><p>A Python backtest on 12 months of Nifty minute data takes 15–40 minutes. The same computation in Rust takes under 30 seconds. This means a trader can run 30 backtests in the time it used to take to run one — enabling real learning and iteration.</p></td></tr></table><h3><strong>Backtesting Capabilities</strong></h3><ul><li>Historical data: NSE EOD data (free) + intraday 1-min data from data providers</li><li>Multi-leg option strategy backtesting: Iron Condor, Straddle, Strangle, Butterfly, Calendar, Ratio spreads</li><li>Greeks simulation across time: See how Delta, Theta, Vega evolved minute by minute</li><li>IV surface reconstruction: Recreate the IV smile on any historical date</li><li>Slippage and brokerage modelling: Built-in Zerodha/Upstox cost structure</li><li>Expiry-level analysis: Track pinning behavior, gamma risk near expiry, and IV crush post-event</li></ul><h3><strong>Signal Engine</strong></h3><ul><li>Rule-based signals: User-defined conditions (PCR &gt; 1.3, IV &lt; 20th percentile, price above 20 EMA, etc.)</li><li>AI-enhanced signals: ML model trained on NSE historical data to score signal confidence from 0–100</li><li>Signal attribution: Every signal is tagged with contributing factors so the AI can explain it</li><li>Paper trading mode: All signals can be paper-traded before going live</li></ul><table><tr><td><p><strong>MODULE 3 — AI Intelligence Layer</strong></p></td></tr></table><h2><strong>5.3  The AI Co-Pilot — The Core Differentiator</strong></h2><p>This is what no competitor does. Every strategy, every backtest, every live signal comes with a plain-English explanation. Not 'IV Rank is 23'. But: 'Implied Volatility is unusually low right now — cheaper than 77% of the last year. This means option premiums are cheap, making it a good time to buy options rather than sell them. If a big move happens, your bought options gain value faster than they decay.'</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>AI Philosophy</strong></p></td><td><p>Every output from OPTIQ answers three questions: What happened?

Risks &amp; Mitigations</strong></h1><h2><strong>10.1  Data Risk — NSE API Access</strong></h2><p>NSE does not provide a free real-time API. If broker API terms change, data access could be disrupted. Mitigation: Always maintain 2 data sources simultaneously. Build broker-agnostic abstraction layer in Rust so switching providers requires no frontend changes.</p><h2><strong>10.2  SEBI Regulatory Risk</strong></h2><p>Providing algorithmic trading signals to retail users may require SEBI Research Analyst registration. Mitigation: Position OPTIQ as an 'education and analytics platform' in Phase 1. Do not provide 'buy/sell' recommendations — instead provide 'signal conditions' and 'analysis'. Get RA registration before Phase 2 live signal launch.</p><h2><strong>10.3  AI Explanation Quality Risk</strong></h2><p>If the AI explanations are generic or wrong, users will churn immediately. Mitigation: Curate a library of 50 verified explanation templates for common scenarios (IV crush, gamma squeeze, trending vs. ranging market). Use Claude API with tightly structured prompts that inject real market data into every explanation.</p><h2><strong>10.4  Technical Complexity Risk</strong></h2><p>Building a Rust engine, AI layer, and real-time data pipeline simultaneously is complex for a small team. Mitigation: Phase approach. Launch with Python backtesting (acceptable for beta), Rust engine comes in Phase 2. The AI explanation feature is the priority — it requires only Python + Claude API and can be built quickly.</p><h1><strong>11. Team &amp; Hiring Plan</strong></h1><h2><strong>Phase 0–1 (Free to ₹2 lakh MRR)</strong></h2><p>This phase can be executed with 2 people: a technical co-founder and the product founder.
